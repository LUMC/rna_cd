Installation
============

``rna_cd`` is now available on PyPI! Simply install the package in your
favorite python environment with:

::

    $ pip install rna-cd

This will install both the ``rna_cd`` python package, and install two
command line tools:

1. ``rna_cd-train``: For training a model using BAM files.
2. ``rna_cd-classify``: For classifying new BAM files.

Supported python versions
-------------------------

We only support the following python versions:

* python 3.5
* python 3.6
* python 3.7

 .. note:: Python 2 is **not** supported in any way. Even attempting to
           install the package on python 2 will result in failures.
